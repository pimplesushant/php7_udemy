This page should include a note on variable lifecycle:

Before a variable is used, it has no existence. It is unset. It is possible to check if a variable doesn't exist by using isset(). This returns true provided the variable exists and isn't set to null. With the exception of null, the value a variable holds plays no part in determining whether a variable is set.

Setting an existing variable to null is a way of unsetting a variable. Another way is variables may be destroyed by using the unset() construct.

<?php
print isset($a); // $a is not set. Prints false. (Or more accurately prints ''.)
$b = 0; // isset($b) returns true (or more accurately '1')
$c = array(); // isset($c) returns true
$b = null; // Now isset($b) returns false;
unset($c); // Now isset($c) returns false;
?>

is_null() is an equivalent test to checking that isset() is false.

The first time that a variable is used in a scope, it's automatically created. After this isset is true. At the point at which it is created it also receives a type according to the context.

<?php
$a_bool = true;   // a boolean
$a_str = 'foo';    // a string
?>

If it is used without having been given a value then it is uninitalized and it receives the default value for the type. The default values are the _empty_ values. E.g  Booleans default to FALSE, integers and floats default to zero, strings to the empty string '', arrays to the empty array.

A variable can be tested for emptiness using empty();

<?php
$a = 0; //This isset, but is empty
?>

Unset variables are also empty.

<?php
empty($vessel); // returns true. Also $vessel is unset.
?>

Everything above applies to array elements too.

<?php
$item = array();
//Now isset($item) returns true. But isset($item['unicorn']) is false.
//empty($item) is true, and so is empty($item['unicorn']

$item['unicorn'] = '';
//Now isset($item['unicorn']) is true. And empty($item) is false.
//But empty($item['unicorn']) is still true;

$item['unicorn'] = 'Pink unicorn';
//isset($item['unicorn']) is still true. And empty($item) is still false.
//But now empty($item['unicorn']) is false;
?>

For arrays, this is important because accessing a non-existent array item can trigger errors; you may want to test arrays and array items for existence with isset before using them.
