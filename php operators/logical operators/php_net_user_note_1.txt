Note that PHP's boolean operators *always* return a boolean value... as opposed to other languages that return the value of the last evaluated expression.

For example:

$a = 0 || 'avacado';
print "A: $a\n";

will print:

A: 1

in PHP -- as opposed to printing "A: avacado" as it would in a language like Perl or JavaScript.

This means you can't use the '||' operator to set a default value:

$a = $fruit || 'apple';

instead, you have to use the '?:' operator:

$a = ($fruit ? $fruit : 'apple');
