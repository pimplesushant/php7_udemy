I would like to stress out that the opening tag is "<?php[whitespace]", not just "<?php". While this might seem blatantly obvious, I thought for some time that

<?php/*blah*/ echo "a"?>

would work, and it does not; the comment does not work as whitespace. I've run into this while converting some older code with short open tag.
